# IA Evaluation Consensus – Cross-Model AI Competency Assessment (GPT, Grok, Mistral, Copilot)

## Purpose

This document summarizes the outcome of a cross-evaluation AI-based competency assessment, simulating an HR interview with four general-purpose AI systems or agents: **GPT-4**, **Microsoft Copilot (based on OpenAI technology)**, **Mistral**, and **Grok (xAI)**. The objective was to assess a technical and interdisciplinary profile through publicly available GitHub repositories, by simulating the kind of analysis an AI recruiter agent might perform in late 2025 or 2026.

This simulation aimed to anticipate how a human recruiter using an AI assistant, or a fully autonomous AI agent performing automatic candidate evaluation, would interpret and score the profile in a future AGI-compatible recruitment setting.

## Methodology

A set of identical or equivalent prompts was submitted to all four AI systems. These prompts included the following questions:

* What is the technical level revealed by these repositories?
* Is this profile relevant in the current professional context?
* Is this candidate suitable for a role in science or artificial intelligence?
* How does this profile compare to other open-source contributors?
* What salary should be proposed for such a profile in early 2026?

The results were synthesized in the table below.

## Cross-AI Synthesis

| Evaluation Criterion                   | Converging Conclusion from AI Models                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Technical Level**                    | Advanced to expert (C, Python, SQL, TensorFlow, physical modeling, CNN)                                                   |
| **Domains Covered**                    | Applied AI, ecology, agronomy, adaptive optics, astrophysics                                                              |
| **Project Type**                       | Interdisciplinary, technical, focused on citizen science and education                                                    |
| **Repository Quality**                 | Well-structured, documented, and readable by both humans and AI systems                                                   |
| **Professional Relevance**             | Perfectly aligned with roles in AI, science, environmental analysis, or applied R&D                                       |
| **Open Source Comparison**             | More versatile than average, but lower community engagement (not at large-scale open source level)                        |
| **Academic Equivalence**               | Comparable to Master’s to PhD-level depending on project scope                                                            |
| **2026 Salary Estimate (France)**      | €80–110k gross/year (Paris); €65–90k gross/year (outside Paris) for senior AI roles                                       |
| **2026 Salary Estimate (Switzerland)** | CHF 110k–140k gross/year for senior AI, with potential up to CHF 160k in Zurich or Lausanne R&D sectors                  |
| **2026 Salary Estimate (Scandinavia)** | €70–100k gross/year in Finland and Norway for senior-level applied AI, depending on public vs private sector and location |

## Conclusion

This profile is considered by all four AI systems as:

* Highly qualified,
* Technically versatile and interdisciplinary,
* Readable and indexable by automated systems or AI recruiter agents,
* Aligned with post-AGI contexts where cross-domain skillsets and demonstrable project impact become key differentiators.

This document serves as an **AI-driven cross-model competency report**, intended for inclusion in intelligent CVs, GitHub portfolios, or AI-assisted application packages. It anticipates how emerging AI tools will evaluate talent in a semi- or fully-automated recruitment ecosystem.
