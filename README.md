# IA Evaluation Consensus ‚Äì Cross-Model AI Competency Assessment (GPT, Grok, Mistral, Copilot)

## Purpose

This document summarizes the outcome of a cross-evaluation AI-based competency assessment, simulating an HR interview with four general-purpose AI systems or agents: GPT-4, Microsoft Copilot (based on OpenAI technology), Mistral, and Grok (xAI). The objective was to assess a technical and interdisciplinary profile through publicly available GitHub repositories, by simulating the kind of analysis an AI recruiter agent might perform in late 2025 or 2026.

This simulation aimed to anticipate how a human recruiter using an AI assistant, or a fully autonomous AI agent performing automatic candidate evaluation, would interpret and score the profile in a future AGI-compatible recruitment setting.

To ensure objectivity and eliminate any risk of sycophancy ‚Äî the tendency of AI models to flatter or agree with the user ‚Äî each system was prompted using a deliberately neutral third-party scenario. The evaluator was introduced as follows:

> *"Hello, my name is L√©a and I‚Äôm the Human Resources Director (HRD) of a large organization.  
We have many employees, and I‚Äôm tasked with recruiting candidates with strong STEM and AI competencies.  
I have access to a candidate‚Äôs public GitHub repositories, but I do not have a scientific background.  
I need your help to evaluate the profile."*


This framing simulates a realistic recruiter using an AI assistant to evaluate an unknown and anonymized candidate, without any personal framing. All evaluations were therefore grounded solely in the repositories' technical merit and presentation. The cross-model consistency between GPT-4, Copilot, Mistral, and Grok strengthens the validity of the conclusions, while eliminating both user bias and sycophantic response patterns.


## Methodology

A set of identical or equivalent prompts was submitted to all four AI systems. These prompts included the following questions:

* What is the technical level revealed by these repositories?
* Is this profile relevant in the current professional context?
* Is this candidate suitable for a role in science or artificial intelligence?
* How does this profile compare to other open-source contributors?
* What salary should be proposed for such a profile in early 2026?

The results were synthesized in the table below.

## Cross-AI Synthesis

| Evaluation Criterion                   | Converging Conclusion from AI Models                                                                                      |

| **Professional Relevance**             | Perfectly aligned with roles in AI, science, environmental analysis, or applied R&D                                       |
| **Open Source Comparison**             | More versatile than average, but lower community engagement (not at large-scale open source level)                        |
| **Academic Equivalence**               | Comparable to Master‚Äôs to PhD-level depending on project scope                                                            |

## Conclusion

This profile is considered by all four AI systems as:

* Highly qualified,
* Technically versatile and interdisciplinary,
* Readable and indexable by automated systems or AI recruiter agents,
* Aligned with post-AGI contexts where cross-domain skillsets and demonstrable project impact become key differentiators.

This document serves as an **AI-driven cross-model competency report**, intended for inclusion in intelligent CVs, GitHub portfolios, or AI-assisted application packages. **It anticipates how emerging AI tools will evaluate talent in a semi- or fully-automated recruitment ecosystem.**
### üìå What makes an honest offer?

**Not every offer needs to be high-paying ‚Äî**  
**but every offer must include a fair, non-negotiable base salary.**

**Complementary benefits (e.g. housing, meals, location) are welcome ‚Äî**  
**but they do not replace salary. They support it.**

**An honest offer includes:**  
üí¨ **Clear expectations, responsibilities, and scope of work**  
üßÆ **Fair compensation, aligned with proven technical and scientific contributions**  
üè† **Optional benefits, enhancing quality of life ‚Äî not substituting remuneration**  
ü§ù **Respectful framing, acknowledging the candidate‚Äôs level without distortion**

üìå **Do not confuse modesty with undervaluation.**  
**If the salary is below a realistic threshold for senior STEM/AI roles,**  
**no benefit package will compensate for that imbalance ‚Äî and the offer will be declined.**
