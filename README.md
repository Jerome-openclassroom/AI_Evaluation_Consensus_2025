# IA Evaluation Consensus – Cross-Model AI Competency Assessment (GPT, Grok, Mistral, Copilot)

## Description
This file provides a detailed AI-driven cross-evaluation of a technical and interdisciplinary profile using public GitHub repositories. It simulates how four leading AI systems (GPT-4, Microsoft Copilot, Mistral, Grok) would assess the same profile either as assistants to HR professionals or as autonomous recruiter agents.

## Purpose
To anticipate how advanced AI models interpret and rate complex profiles in a future recruitment environment (late 2025–2026), where both manual and automated evaluations by AI agents are expected.

## Usage
Use this file to showcase the expected interpretation of your GitHub portfolio by intelligent systems, as part of a smart CV, AI evaluation package, or research dossier.
